#+TITLE: Machine Learning Fundamentals

* Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections.

** Key Components

- *Neurons*: Basic processing units that receive inputs, apply weights, and produce outputs
- *Layers*: Collections of neurons organized in input, hidden, and output layers  
- *Weights*: Parameters that determine the strength of connections between neurons
- *Activation Functions*: Mathematical functions that introduce non-linearity

** Training Process

The training process involves:

1. Forward propagation: Data flows through the network
2. Loss calculation: Compare predictions with actual results
3. Backpropagation: Adjust weights to minimize error
4. Iteration: Repeat until convergence

** Applications

Neural networks are used in:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing  
- Speech recognition
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles

This is fundamental knowledge for anyone starting in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
