#+TITLE: AI Ethics and Bias

* Ethical Considerations in AI

As artificial intelligence systems become more prevalent, we must consider their ethical implications.

** Algorithmic Bias

Machine learning models can perpetuate and amplify existing biases in training data.

** Fairness and Transparency

AI systems should be fair, transparent, and accountable, especially in high-stakes applications.

* Key Principles

- Beneficence: AI should benefit humanity
- Non-maleficence: AI should not cause harm
- Autonomy: Humans should maintain control
- Justice: Benefits and risks should be distributed fairly

Neural networks and deep learning systems require special attention to bias detection and mitigation.
