#+TITLE: Deep Learning with Transformers

* Transformer Architecture

The transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing and has been adapted for many other domains.

** Attention Mechanisms

Self-attention allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each element.

** Multi-head Attention

Multiple attention heads capture different types of relationships in the data simultaneously.

* Applications

Transformers are used in:
- GPT models for text generation
- BERT for language understanding  
- Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification
- DALL-E for image generation

The attention mechanism is the key innovation that makes transformers so powerful for sequence modeling.
